# yii2-keycdn
A Yii2 extension for some KeyCDN lovin' that's so simple even your dog will be able to use it.

## Defining the Extension

Here is the full definition, from an example:

    'rackspace' => [
    	'class' => 'sammaye\rackspace\Rackspace',
    	'identityEndpoint' => 'US_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT',
    	'username' => 'SomeNotSoAwesomeUser',
    	'apiKey' => 'AwesomeKeyInit'
    ],
    
Everything is quite self explanatory except for `identityEndpoint`. This is a string representation of the constant name.

At the time of writing there are currently two values for the `identityEndpoint` option:

- `US_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT`
- `UK_IDENTITY_ENDPOINT`

These directly relate to the SDK's own.

Now with this definition you can just use the API like the component doesn't even exist, for example:

    $cdn = Yii::$app->rackspace->cdnService();
    var_dump($cdn->listServices());
